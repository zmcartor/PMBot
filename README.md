PMBot
=====

IRC Bot PM for your channel adds amazing business value for every enterprise engagement

Want to get started? Let me solution that for you:
ruby bot.rb --channel "#channel password"

These switches also work should you require a different deliverable:
ruby bot --channel #channel --server irc.server.net --nick CoolBot

### Is this some kind of joke?
This program is a work of humor. We believe PMs are an integral part of the
development process. It's not easy wrangling devs, removing roadblocks, and
delivering software on time and budget. A great PM is like a great quarterback;
they elevate the excellence of the entire team. The converse is also true. If your PM
reminds you of this bot, well, hopefully you have a good running game.
